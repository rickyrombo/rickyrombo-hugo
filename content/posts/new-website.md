I'm currently in the process of moving my website from PHP/MySQL with [Laravel](http://laravel.com) to a static site using [Hugo](http://gohugo.io). Pretty soon, [rickyrombo.com](http://rickyrombo.com) will point to this GitHub page instead of going to some folder on [AwestruckDesign](http://awestruckdesign.com) or website on [Heroku](http://heroku.com).

I've also been thinking of ways to improve the website. Some things on the list:

  * Add play icons on hover
  * Add SoundCloud authentication
  * Add page for free downloads (using the authentication)
  * Add ability to like/share sounds
  * Start making a music blog/distribution platform for handpicked songs
  * Infinite scrolling (favorites has it already, now for "Followings"!)

As you can see, there's a lot to do! So far, I'm extremely glad I switched to Hugo. I think it will make life much easier, and blogging way better. Bye, CMS systems. Bye, PHP. Hello beautiful Markdown, command line, and Git.
