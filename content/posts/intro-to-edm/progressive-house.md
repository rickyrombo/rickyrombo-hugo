Progressive house is probably the most popular and most produced form of electronic music. Take a look at the [massive list of progressive house producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_progressive_house_artists) and you'll probably see a lot of names you'll recognize: deadmau5, Zedd, The Chainsmokers, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia, and many others. It's my personal favorite subgenre of house.

The "drop" of progressive house tracks (if applicable) generally emphasizes a melody instead of a percussion or kick. The genre can be defined by its layers or levels of phrases (a series of "bars" or essentially a loop pattern) that build up a slow "progression" into the more energetic "drop" phrase (if there is one). Interestingly enough, the "progression" of the track isn't namesake of the genre. I won't go into the history of these genres, but you can [peruse Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_house#Etymology) to get a general overview.

The sound elements used in progressive house are very melodic. The main synth usually sounds somewhat like sawtooth waveform. Many progressive house songs modulate the attack and/or filter of the sawtooth synth to create a plucky sound that will open up into a more full sounding synth for the drop. Some songs will have real instrument sounds in them. Pianos are a popular element.

This progressive house remix of Zedd's Clarity was [the winner of the remix competition](https://www.facebook.com/Zedd/posts/533693530016090). It was first posted on YouTube as a troll claiming to be a deadmau5 remix. Note how the build is long and "progresses" without any drums for the first two minutes, and slowly introduces the new sounds. The plucky sawtooth synth (the one that starts as a low sound and opens up - it's introduced at about a minute into the song) is one good way to identify the genre. This song is an incredibly good example of the original style of progressive house.

It took a bit of searching but I found an upload of "All I Have" by deadmau5 somewhere on SoundCloud. Notice how similar the plucky synth is to the one in Tom Budin's remix of Clarity above. Deadmau5 also doesn't bring the kick in until a few phrases have passed.

Though it is [classified by Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/I_Remember_(deadmau5_and_Kaskade_song)) as electro house, I would argue that it's more progressive. The plucks give it away, as does the repetition and building. Also note the sections that the beat drops out, and the song has to build its way back up in the phrasing emphasized earlier.

Note the repetitions and the phrasing behind adding elements. Feel the way the song builds up over time and seems to be constantly "progressing" towards something. The addition of different sounds is pretty easy to hear and happens gradually.

I miss Swedish House Mafia. Songs like this are the reason I fell in love with EDM. Again, listen to the repetitions and the adding of different sounds and elements. This one probably has the most energetic drop of those I've inroduced so far, and is probably the most danceable. You might have noticed the trend, as I've carefully selected each song to be getting closer and closer to what today's progressive house sounds like.

## Not what you expected?

Let me now introduce you to "mainroom house." Progressive house now gets used as a catch-all for mainroom house, which are songs you might hear in the mainroom of a club. The drops become the core of the song, and the kick comes out stronger in the mix. There's generally a higher energy experience, and the songs feel more danceable. The songs become structured much more like pop songs - they become shorter, more often include lyrics, and have quicker builds and less of the "pluck" sound.

{{% sound url="https://soundcloud.com/stevejamesofficial/the-chainsmokers-let-you-go-steve-james-remix" %}} Steve James would definitely fall into the progressive house category even though his tracks sound almost nothing like deadmau5 or the Tom Budin remix above. The original song by the Chainsmokers could also be described as progressive house. The drop includes the same synth melody but with a heavier kick and some open sawtooth synths for that higher energy. Note the way the build goes up until everything "drops" away and you're left with only the vocal for a beat before the drop kicks in. That style of drop will be very common for this subgenre.

Tritonal and Cash Cash are both mostly progressive house producers. They're two of the bigger names in progressive house. Listen to the lead synth - that sort of lead tends to appear in progressive house songs. Also, notice the piano backing the song throughout. Progressive house tends to be more melodic and so you'll find piano or guitar sounds to be fairly common.

Two Friends (back when they were "The Two Friends") were known for their progressive house. Take a look at a couple other Two Friends songs for more examples of progressive house's new sound: "Long Way Home" and "Our Name In Lights" are more quintessential progressive house.

Another Two Friends remix, this time of RAC. Notice how late the drop comes and the emphasis on the melody and music over percussion and weird sounding sound effects.

Elephante has [tons of remixes](https://soundcloud.com/iamtheelephante/) (and is now releasing [his debut EP](https://soundcloud.com/iamtheelephante/sets/i-am-the-elephante)) and most of them are progressive house (although perhaps some could be considered electro house). By this point you should be able to hear the synth sounds sounding fairly familiar. Progressive house tends to build up with the same synth it "drops" with, and the "drop" is simply more aggressive and with a bigger backing ensemble. The main synth in many Elephante songs sounds "buzzy," which is a.

I absolutely love every one of Mako's songs. They are the epitome of emotion-filled electronic music. This song is sure to draw out good feels and give your heart warmth. While you enjoy it, notice the emphasis on guitar and piano elements and the relaxed synth sounds. Also notice how the structure is almost identical to a general pop song - there's just a larger emphasis on the build/chorus structures (and the chorus and drop are played separately).

This Elephante remix of the above song hits a little bit harder. It takes a lot of the electro house elements I'll talk about in the next section and applies them to a progressive house song. Notice the guitar and piano sounds are less emphasized and more synthetic/electronic sounds are added.

Now this song is definitely the most "pop." In fact, it *is* pop. This song is 100% pop (by definition, of being popular - and also by structure and the vocal "nah nah" in the chorus (in this case "bah bah")) and yet it's also still described as progressive house. The you can totally hear the contrast between this example and the first two examples. Progressive house has been changing to be quicker, more exciting, and heavier on the drum pattern. One main reason for this is for live shows. The original progressive house genre was too difficult or too niche for a general live audience. It took too long to build and the audience would lose interest. DJs could try to mix just the drop into their performance (if it had one), but the reality is that without the build, the drops of original progressive house didn't have the same impact. Producers wanted their listeners to dance (and obviously to also reach more listeners), and so the genre adapted and pivoted closer to pop. It's similar to what happened with country music and rock music.

I hope that helps you define progressive house and determine if a song is progressive house in the future. As you try to understand and categorize music, it's important you realize tracks might not be clear cut. I've already mentioned how some songs crossover between electro house and progressive house, but even more "genre-breakers" are going to pop up as we cover more genres subgenres.
