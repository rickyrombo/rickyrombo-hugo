Progressive house is probably the most popular and most produced form of electronic music. Take a look at the [massive list of progressive house producers](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_progressive_house_artists) and you'll probably see a lot of names you'll recognize: deadmau5, Zedd, The Chainsmokers, Kaskade, Swedish House Mafia. It's my personal favorite subgenre.

What makes progressive house distinct is the emphasis on a building, rising "progression" of the track into its climax that has a melodic emphasis rather than a percussive one. Interestingly enough, the "progression" of the track isn't namesake of the genre. I won't go into the history of these genres, but you can [peruse Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Progressive_house#Etymology) to get a general overview. The progression of the track comes in phrases, which are a power of two number of bars. Think of each "pattern" or "loop" as a bar if you're not familiar with the concept. Also, progressive house seems to be more melodic and has more variance than most other house genres.

This progressive house remix of Zedd's Clarity was a winner of the remix competition.  Note how the build is long and "progresses" without any drums for the first two minutes, and slowly introduces the new sounds. The plucky sawtooth synth (the one that starts as a low sound and opens up) is one good way to identify the genre. This song is an incredibly good example of the original style of progressive house.

It took a bit of searching but I found an upload of "All I Have" by deadmau5 somewhere on SoundCloud. That plucky sawtooth in the intro, and the length of time it takes to add new elements is very, very indicative of Progressive House.

This collaboration between MitiS and MaHi is old but a good example of the structure of progressive house even today. The drop may not be as heavy on the drums/bass as some progressive songs are nowadays and I think that's due to the genre changing to become more of a "pop" song structure now. The next few examples are good examples of that - note that the next couple examples hit a bit harder and have a lot more of a "pop" vibe to them.

Progressive house doesn't have to mean excruciatingly slow and calm. Many tracks these days take the ideas from progressive house and attempt to do a quicker, more direct route, trimming the excessive buildup time. This track is very upbeat and energetic, but listen to the way the song starts reasonably calm and progressively gets more and more energy. The original song by the Chainsmokers could also be described as progressive house. Note how the drop includes the same synth melody but with a heavier backing. Also note the way the build goes up until everything "drops" away and you're left with only the vocal for a split second before the drop kicks in.

Tritonal and Cash Cash are both mostly Progressive House producers. They're two of the bigger names in Progressive House. Listen to the lead synth - that sort of lead tends to appear in Progressive House songs. Also, notice the piano backing the song throughout. Progressive house tends to be more melodic and use more real instrument sounds (not saying they aren't synthesized!).

Two Friends (back when they were "The Two Friends") were known for their progressive house. This is a remix of Echosmith done in collaboration with Gazzo that makes for a good track that people will know and recognize. Honestly their songs "Long Way Home" and "Our Name In Lights" are more quintessential progressive house songs but this song helps exemplify where progressive house is going. It's getting bigger sounding and much more "pop" sounding.

Another Two Friends remix, this time of RAC. Notice how late the drop comes and the emphasis on the melody and music over percussion and electronic effects.

Elephante has a huge amount of tracks and most of them are progressive house. By this point you should be able to hear the synth sounds sounding fairly familiar. Progressive house tends to build up with the same synth it "drops" with, and the "drop" is simply more aggressive and with a bigger backing ensemble.

I absolutely love every one of Mako's songs. They are the epitome of emotion-filled electronic music. This song is sure to draw out good feels and give your heart warmth. While you enjoy it, notice the emphasis on guitar and piano elements and the relaxed synth sounds. Also notice how the structure is almost identical to a pop song - there's just a small difference between the chorus/build structures.

This Elephante remix of the above song hits a little bit harder. It takes a lot of the electro house elements I'll talk about in the next section and applies them to a progressive house song. Notice the guitar and piano sounds are less emphasized and more synthetic/electronic sounds are added.

Now this song is definitely the most "pop." In fact, it *is* pop. This song is 100% pop (by definition, of being popular) and yet I would still describe it as progressive house. The you can totally hear the contrast between this example and the first two examples. Most of that is due to progressive house changing as a genre to be more exciting, driving, and impactful. One main reason for this is for live shows. The original progressive house genre was much more difficult or niche for a live audience. It took way too long to build and the audience would lose interest. You could try to mix just the drop into your mix, but the reality is that without the build, the drops of progressive house didn't hit hard enough to make it danceable.
