Electro house is similar to [progressive house](/posts/intro-to-edm/progressive-house), at least the newer, "pop" version of progressive house that I call mainroom house. It hits harder, is made more for clubs and DJing, and has a lot more synthetic sounds. There's not as much of a "layering" that happens. Usually all the sounds jump in very quickly or all at once. In my opinion, the best way to decide if a song is electro house or progressive house is to evaluate how "human" or "electronic" it sounds. If you think the sounds are more rough, electronic, and synthetic, chances are it's an electro house song. If the sounds used are like real instruments, or the vocals are emphasized, or it feels melodic, chances are it's a progressive house song. These two genres are easy to jump between and easy to mix up.

My friend Peter Helstrom, (DJ Facing Tomorrow or "F2m") made this mix for New Years a few years ago. It's filled with electro house. You'll notice there's a lot of Savant in there. I think it's safe to say Peter likes Savant.

Also note that there are a few songs that aren't technically electro house. For instance, "Fn Pig" by deadmau5 might be considered progressive house (at least I would describe it as progressive house).

Benny Benassi is the "forerunner of electro-house who brought it to the mainstream," according to [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_house). Note the lack of adding/subtracting layers (besides thickening the lead) or melodies or really any movement whatsoever. It's essentially the same pattern throughout with slight increases

Something tells me most people would prefer this remix to the original. Or really any remix, given how old the original is. This remix is already 6 years old itself, but it's yet another good example of electro house. It adds a bit more variety to the song, and a bit more energy and effects.

Another song mentioned in the [same Wikipedia article](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Electro_house), I felt it necessary to include this classic as well. This one came up around 2006. It's fairly minimal and doesn't include the large/wide synths you might expect.

{{% youtube title="BSOD - This Is The Hook" url="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Jo9wJaFl1Ww" %}}
"Produced with his pal Steve Duda in 2006, "This Is the Hook" is a house track, Zimmerman says, "about how simple it is to make a house track."" ([The Rolling Stones](http://www.rollingstone.com/music/features/from-deadmau5-to-your-house-20110217)). The track was made as a joke but made it to #1 on Beatport. You might think that BSOD was a Windows "blue screen of death" jab and you would be partially right, although according to the pair it actually stands for ["Better Sounding on Drugs"](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=bv2YVKEnvko). Fun fact, Steve Duda is the programmer behind [Xfer Records](https://xferrecords.com/). Personally, I would say these first four songs are simply "house" tracks and not "electro house" as I don't think they include enough of the same elements you'll see below.

Ten years after Satisfaction, the sound has evolved to have a lot more going on and have a higher amount of energy. Porter Robinson's Language might remind you some of the progressive/mainroom house songs from that last article. This one is a close call, but the more aggressive synthline and heavier drop gives it away.

One of the most popular electro house songs out there, Ghosts n' Stuff features vocalist Rob Swire of Pendulum and Knife Party. It's an extremely catchy song, and good luck getting it out of your head. See if you can notice the different sounds. Unlike progressive house, electro house is fairly focused on the electronic elements and trying to get the most bang out of them.

{{% spotify title="Knife Party - Internet Friends" url="https://open.spotify.com/track/5qFL2uwfnGU8FccwLMgPNQ" uri="spotify:track:5qFL2uwfnGU8FccwLMgPNQ" %}}
Speaking of Knife Party, they too have made songs of the electro house variety (along with pretty much every other trendy EDM you could think of from drum and bass to dubstep to big room house). Notice the gritty bass, and all the synthetic sounding effects.

OVERWERK's sound has to be one of the best examples of how electro house sounds more gritty, intense, and synthetic. I'd also have you check out [Exist](https://soundcloud.com/overwerk/exist-original-mix), [Daybreak](https://soundcloud.com/overwerk/daybreak), and [I Feel Better](https://soundcloud.com/overwerk/i-feel-better) by OVERWERK because his sound serves as such a great example of electro house.

Remember how Elephante can tow the line between progressive and electro? Songs like this are definitely more aggressive and more electro. Note the drop's distinct grit sound.

Wolfgang Gartner also tows the line between progressive and electro house. It's hard to tell sometimes, but generally speaking the electro house songs are harder hitting and more aggressive.

This is hard to place due to Swedish House Mafia being a big name of progressive house, although I would say this song leans more electro. I had to ask a few friends what they thought about it, so if you're having a hard time telling the difference then join the club. In my mind the main key difference is the aggressiveness, grit, bass, and drop emphasis.

Electro house tends to get pretty close to the mainroom/bigroom sound. If you count everything that's been classified as mainroom house as electro house as opposed to progressive, then electro house becomes the new biggest genre. I think it's pretty much a toss up for where mainroom falls, but I've definitely heard progressive house used more to describe it than electro house. In any case, we're still only focused on house, and only two subgenres in, so don't worry there will be more distinct genres to come that will give you some more variety. I think the two (or three counting mainroom) genres I've covered here are likely the most debated and that's why I put them first on my list, so don't feel frustrated if they sound similar to you or if you're confused.
