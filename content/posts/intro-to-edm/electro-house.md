Electro house is very similar to [progressive house](/posts/intro-to-edm/progressive-house), at least the newer, "pop" version of progressive house. It hits harder, is made more for dancing, and has a lot more synthetic sounds. There's not as much of a "layering" that happens. Usually all the sounds jump in very quickly or all at once. The best way to decide if a song is electro house or progressive house is to evaluate how "human" or "electronic" it sounds. If you think the sounds are more rough, electronic, and synthetic, chances are it's an electro house song. If the sounds used are like real instruments, or the vocals are emphasized, or it feels melodic and, well, progressive, chances are it's a progressive house song. These two genres are easy to jump between and easy to mix up.

My friend Peter Helstrom, (DJ Facing Tomorrow or "F2m") made this mix for New Years a few years ago. It's filled with electro house. You'll notice there's a lot of Savant in there. I think it's safe to say Peter likes Savant.

Also note that there are a few songs that aren't technically electro house. For instance, "Fn Pig" by deadmau5 is progressive house (at least I would describe it as progressive house).

I think this is all you'll need as far as understanding electro house (yes, I'm getting lazy).

One of the most popular electro house songs out there.
