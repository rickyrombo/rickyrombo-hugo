House music generally sits at 125-130bpm (usually 128bpm). It's drum pattern is fairly repetitive, with a kick on every quarter note and a snare or clap on every half note (which is optional - not all house music has the snare/clap). The drum pattern is referred to as "four on the floor," which I've assumed is because it's hitting the kick on each of the four beats per measure in the 4/4 time signature and the kick pedal and drum sit on the floor in a real drum kit, but I don't know the actual reason. In any case, the pattern is a kick every quarter note in a 4/4 time signature, for all the people with music theory backgrounds.

A large amount of pop songs you hear on the radio or in clubs could be considered house music (generally speaking). Almost everything by Calvin Harris, deadmau5, Zedd, and David Guetta is house music (and [all these people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_house_music_artists) are house artists). I'll try to keep my examples to some of my favorite fairly popular songs or favorite remixes of popular songs, but the focus is on songs that illustrate some core concepts.

Within house music, there are more subgenres based on the energy and the bassline. My next few posts will go into each subgenre in detail, starting with "progressive house."

If you're interested, you should read up on the [origin of house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music#Origins_.281980s.29) on Wikipedia. It's pretty interesting.
