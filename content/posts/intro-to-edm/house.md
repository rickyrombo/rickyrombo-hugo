House music generally sits at 125-130bpm (usually 128bpm). It's drum pattern is fairly repetitive, with a kick on every quarter note and a snare or clap on every half note (which is optional - not all house music has the snare/clap). The drum pattern is referred to as "four on the floor," which I've always thought is because it's hitting the kick on each of the four beats per measure in the 4/4 time signature and the kick pedal and drum sit on the floor in a real drum kit (or perhaps it refers to the dance floor).

In any case, a large amount of pop songs you hear on the radio or in clubs could be considered house music (generally speaking). Everything from Calvin Harris and David Guetta is house music, for example (and [all these people](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_house_music_artists) are house artists). I'll try to keep my examples fairly popular or remixes of popular songs, but the focus is on songs that illustrate some core concepts.

Within house music, there are more subgenres based on the energy and the bassline. My next few posts will go into each subgenre in detail, starting with "progressive house."

Types of house music I'll try to cover:

- Progressive House
- Electro House
- Big Room/Festival House
- Deep House

If you're interested, you should read up on the [origin of house](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/House_music#Origins_.281980s.29) on Wikipedia. It's pretty interesting.
